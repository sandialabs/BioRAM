# BioRAM
BioSafety and BioSecurity Laboratory Risk Assessment Tool

You can use either the excel version or the Java versions.  

For the excel, the biosafety-2016 is the newest and biosecurity-2020.  

For the Java version, you will need the BioRAM-4.0.5.exe or BioRAM-4.0.5.jar and correct .raml file.  BioSafety.raml is the model for biosafety risk assessments, and Biosecurity.raml for security assessments.  The files with 2-digit iso extensions are translated versions of the questions.

The BioRAM 4.0 Directions will review the details on opening and using the BioRAM tool.  

For Chemical Security assessments, the ChemSAM files can be used. 

Source code is availble in the .zip file
