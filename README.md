# BioRAM
BioSafety and BioSecurity Laboratory Risk Assessment Tool

You can use either the excel version or the Java versions.  

For the excel, the BioRAM-2022 (BioRisk) file is the newest and joins the safety and security assessment into a single assessment tool. 

(The monkey pox files include an example biorisk assessment of a laboratory conducting diagnostics on monkey pox.)

For the Java version, you will need the BioRAM-4.0.5.exe or BioRAM-4.0.5.jar and correct .raml file.  BioSafety.raml is the model for biosafety risk assessments, and Biosecurity.raml for security assessments.  The files with 2-digit iso extensions are translated versions of the questions.

The BioRAM 4.0 Directions will review the details on opening and using the Java BioRAM tool.  

For Chemical Security assessments, the ChemSAM files can be used. 

Source code is availble in the .zip file
